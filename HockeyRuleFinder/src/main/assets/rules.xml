For the purposes of these playing rules, any reference to "player" shall refer to both skaters and goalkeepers. Any reference to "goalkeeper" shall mean that the section of the rule is specific to goalkeepers.</par>
                <par>At the beginning of each game, the Manager or Coach of each team shall list the players who shall be eligible to play in the game. Not more than eighteen (18) skaters and two (2) goalkeepers, shall be permitted. One non-uniformed player shall be permitted on the players' bench in a coaching capacity. He must be indicated on the Roster Sheet submitted by the Coach to the Referee or Official Scorer prior to the start of the game.</par>

                <par>Only players on the list submitted to the Official Scorer before the game may participate in the game. The determining factor when considering whether or not a player is eligible is that the player's name, and not necessarily the player's number, must be correctly listed by the Manager or Coach of that team.</par>
                <par>If a goal is scored when an ineligible player is on the ice (whether he was involved in the scoring or not), the goal will be disallowed. This only applies to the goal scored at the stoppage of play whereby the player was deemed to be ineligible. All other goals scored previously by the ineligible player's team (with him on the ice or not) shall be allowed. The ineligible player will be removed from the game and the Club shall not be able to substitute another player from its roster. No additional penalties are to be assessed but a report of the incident must be submitted to the Commissioner. For an ineligible goalkeeper, see [link=5.3]5.3[/link].</par>

                <par>In regular League and Playoff games, if both listed goalkeepers are incapacitated, that team shall be entitled to dress and play any available goalkeeper who is eligible. This goalkeeper is eligible to sit on the player's bench, in uniform. In the event that the two regular goalkeepers are injured or incapacitated in quick succession, the third goalkeeper shall be provided with a reasonable amount of time to get dressed, in addition to a two-minute warm-up (except when he enters the game to defend against a penalty shot). If, however, the third goalkeeper is dressed and on the bench when the second goalkeeper becomes incapacitated, the third goalkeeper shall enter the game immediately and no warm-up is permitted.</par>
                <par>The recalling of minor league goalkeepers (as a result of suspensions incurred to both goalkeepers under Rule [link=11]11[/link] - Goalkeeper's Equipment) to ensure a complete lineup for subsequent games shall be deemed to be an emergency recall and subject to the twenty-three (23) man roster limitations.</par>

Any Captain, Alternate Captain or any player who comes off the bench and makes any protest or intervention with the officials for any purpose shall be assessed a minor penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct under Rule [link=39]39[/link] - Abuse of Officials. Should this protest continue, he may be assessed a misconduct penalty, and if it further continues, a game misconduct penalty shall be warranted.</par>

                <par>For an infraction of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed upon the offending team, provided such infraction is called to the attention of the Referee before the second face-off in the first period takes place. This is an appeal play and must be brought to the Referee's attention prior to the second face-off in the game. There is no penalty to the requesting team if their appeal is unsustained. The determining factor when considering whether or not a player or goalkeeper is listed in the starting line-up is that the player or goalkeeper's name, and not necessarily the player or goalkeeper's number, must be correctly listed by the Manager or Coach of that team.</par>
                <par>In the event a team scores on the first shift of the game, and it is brought to the attention of the Referee by the opposing team that the team that scored did not have the correct starting line-up on the ice, the goal shall be allowed and a bench minor penalty assessed to the offending team for having an improper starting line-up. If the team that scores the goal on the first shift of the game challenges the starting line-up of the opposing team and the opposing team did not have the correct starting line-up, the scoring of the goal would nullify the bench minor penalty and no further penalties would be assessed.</par>

                <par>When a player is injured or compelled to leave the ice during a game, he may retire from the game and be replaced by a substitute, but play must continue without the teams leaving the ice.</par>
                <par>During the play, if an injured player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, he must do so at the players' bench and not through any other exit leading from the rink. This is not a legal player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed.</par>
                <par>If a penalized player has been injured, he may proceed to the dressing room without the necessity of taking a seat on the penalty bench. If the injured player receives a minor penalty, the penalized team shall immediately put a substitute player on the penalty bench, who shall serve the penalty until such time as the injured player is able to return to the game. He would replace his teammate on the penalty bench at the next stoppage of play. If the injured player receives a major penalty, the penalized team shall place a substitute player on the penalty bench before the penalty expires and no other replacement for the penalized player shall be permitted to enter the game except from the penalty bench. For violation of this rule, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed.</par>
                <par>Should the injured penalized player who has been replaced on the penalty bench return to his players' bench prior to the expiration of his penalty, he shall not be eligible to play until his penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when his substitute is still in the penalty box awaiting a stoppage in play. The injured player must wait until his substitute has been released from the penalty box before he is eligible to play. If, however, there is a stoppage of play prior to the expiration of his penalty, he must then replace his teammate on the penalty bench and return to play once his penalty has expired.</par>
                <par>When a player is injured so that he cannot continue play or go to his bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured player's team has secured control of the puck. If the player's team is in control of the puck at the time of injury, play shall be stopped immediately unless his team is in a scoring position.</par>
                <par>In the case where it is obvious that a player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesman may stop the play immediately.</par>
                <par>When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesman due to an injured player, or whenever an injured player is attended to on the ice by the Trainer or medical personnel, such player must be substituted for immediately. This injured player cannot return to the ice until play has resumed.</par>
                <par>When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured player's team has control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at one of the face-off spots outside the blue line in the neutral zone. When the injured player is in his defending zone and the attacking team is in possession of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at one of the defending team's end-zone face-off spots.</par>

The substitute goalkeeper shall be allowed a two (2) minute warm-up during all pre-season games. No warm-up shall be permitted for a substitute goalkeeper in all regular League or Playoff games.</par>

                <par>When a substitution for the regular goalkeeper has been made, such regular goalkeeper shall not resume his position until the next stoppage of play. For a violation, a minor penalty for delay of game shall be assessed.</par>
                <par>When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesman due to an injured goalkeeper, such goalkeeper must be substituted for only if he has to proceed to the players' bench to receive medical attention. If the Trainer has come onto the ice to attend to the goalkeeper and there is no undue delay, the goalkeeper may remain in the game without substitute. However, no additional time shall be permitted by the Referee for the purpose of enabling the injured goalkeeper to resume his position (i.e. no warm-up).</par>

                <par>The Referee shall take the stick to the penalty bench where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both teams shall retire to their respective benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade - this will determine the location of the heel. Using a League-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the stick, the Referee shall use a measuring tape.</par>
                <par>The result shall be reported to the Penalty Timekeeper, who shall record it on the back of the Penalty Record form.

                <par>If the complaint is not sustained, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed against the complaining Club in addition to a fine of one hundred dollars ($100).</par>

Any pads deemed too large for a goalkeeper will be considered illegal equipment for that goalkeeper, regardless of whether or not they would have fallen within previous equipment maximums. The minimum length of the boot of the pad is to be no less than seven inches (7''). The goal pad must have a defined boot channel with no inserts. The channel must be big enough so that the skate slots into it and is not resting on the pad. No attachments such as plastic puck foils are permitted. Pads can only be ten and one-half inches (101/2'') deep. The measurement will be taken from the front face of the pad to the last edge of the inner knee protection.</par>

Calf-wings must be inset one-half inch (1/2'') from the inside five-hole, creating a distinct edge, and attached to the back cover. Calf-wing protectors must be one piece and cannot include wedges (removable or non-removable). Calf-wing protectors may be flat for five and one-half inches (51/2'') before contouring to the shape of the leg. Calf-wing protectors must contour and cannot be visible to the shooter when strapped to the goalkeeper's leg. Calf-wing protectors may not exceed one inch (1") in thickness. Calf-wing protector straps must run through or wrap around so the calf protector follows the contour of the goalkeeper's leg even if the straps are worn loosely. No zippers, Velcro, or Velcro attachments are allowed.</par>
                <par>The knee strap pad is not to exceed six inches (6'') in length by five and one-half inches (51/2'') in width. The knee strap pad must be fastened to the inner risers/lifts The inner knee risers are not to exceed seven inches (7") in length by five and one-half inches (51/2'') in width. The length of seven inches (7") is measured from where the inner padding attaches to the leg pad and back to the end of the inner padding. The total measurement of the entire inner knee padding (pad risers) including the outer knee strap pad must not exceed two and one-half inches (21/2'') in thickness and will be measured when non-compressed. Knee strap pads and riser/lifts must have a one inch (1") radius (rounded) on the top edge. Knee straps must wrap around the knee build-ups and cannot come out behind or through knee build-ups. Medial rolls (raised seam ridges) will not be permitted. All knee protection attached to the leg pad must be worn under the thigh guard of the pant.</par>

He shall then place the puck on the center face-off spot and the player taking the shot will, on the instruction of the Referee (by blowing his whistle), play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent's goal line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the goal post or crossbar, then the goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the goal line or comes to a complete stop, the shot shall be considered complete.</par>
                <par>The lacrosse-like move whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and "whipped" into the net shall be permitted provided the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar. See also [link=80.1]80.1[/link].</par>
                <par>The spin-o-rama type move where the player completes a 360° turn as he approaches the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a player perform such a move during the penalty shot, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result.</par>
                <par>Only a player designated as a goalkeeper or alternate goalkeeper may defend against the penalty shot.</par>
                <par>The goalkeeper must remain in his crease until the player taking the penalty shot has touched the puck.</par>
                <par>If at the time a penalty shot is awarded, the goalkeeper of the penalized team has been removed from the ice to substitute another player, the goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the penalty shot is taken.</par>
                <par>The team against whom the penalty shot has been assessed may replace their goalkeeper to defend against the penalty shot, however, the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play.</par>
                <par>While the penalty shot is being taken, players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the rink and in front of their own player's bench.</par>

            <rule ruleid="24.3" rulename="Designated Player">
                <par>In cases where a penalty shot has been awarded to a player specifically fouled, that player shall be designated by the Referee to take the penalty shot.</par>
                <par>In all other cases where a penalty shot has been awarded, the penalty shot shall be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice at the time when the foul was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed.</par>
                <par>If by reason of injury, the player designated by the Referee to take the penalty shot is unable to do so within a reasonable time, the shot may be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice when the foul was committed. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot be changed.</par>
                <par>Should the player in respect to whom a penalty shot has been awarded himself commit a foul in connection with the same play or circumstances, either before or after the penalty shot has been awarded, be designated to take the shot, he shall first be permitted to do so before being sent to the penalty bench to serve the penalty except when such penalty is for a game misconduct or match penalty in which case the penalty shot shall be taken by a player selected by the Captain of the non-offending team from the players on the ice at the time when the foul was committed.</par>

            <rule ruleid="24.4" rulename="Violations During the Shot">
                <par>Should the goalkeeper leave his crease prior to the player taking the penalty shot has touched the puck, and in the event of violation of this rule or any foul committed by a goalkeeper, the Referee shall allow the shot to be taken and if the shot fails, he shall permit the penalty shot to be taken over again. When an infraction worthy of a minor penalty is committed by the goalkeeper during the penalty shot that causes the shot to fail, no penalty is to be assessed but the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again. Should a goalkeeper commit a second violation during the penalty shot and the shot fails, he shall be assessed a misconduct penalty and the Referee shall permit the penalty shot to be taken over again. A third such violation shall result in the goalkeeper being assessed a game misconduct penalty.</par>
                <par>When a major or match penalty is committed by the goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the shot to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the goalkeeper.</par>
                <par>The goalkeeper may attempt to stop the shot in any manner except by throwing his stick or any object, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded.</par>
                <par>During the shot, should the goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall make one of the following determinations:</par>
                <par>(i) Award a goal if he deems the player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged.</par>
                <par>(ii) Allow the shot to be re-taken if he does not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net.</par>
                <par>(iii) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the goal line thus ending the shot, the above determinations do not apply, the shot is complete.</par>
                <par>If, while the penalty shot is being taken, any player, Coach or non-playing Club personnel of the opposing team shall have by some action interfered with or distracted the player taking the shot and, because of such action, the shot should have failed, a second attempt shall be permitted and the Referee shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team, and if a player on the bench is responsible, a misconduct penalty on the player so interfering or distracting shall be assessed. When a Coach or non-playing Club personnel is guilty of such an act, he shall be automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the dressing room and the matter will be reported to the Commissioner for possible further disciplinary action.</par>
                <par>If, while the penalty shot is being taken, any player, goalkeeper, Coach or non-playing Club personnel of the team taking the shot shall have by some action interfered with or distracted the goalkeeper defending the shot and, because of such action, the shot was successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team, and if a player or goalkeeper on the bench is responsible, a misconduct penalty on the player or goalkeeper so interfering or distracting shall be assessed. When a Coach or non-playing Club personnel is guilty of such an act, he shall be automatically suspended from the game, ordered to the dressing room and the matter will be reported to the Commissioner for possible further disciplinary action.</par>
                <par>If, while the penalty shot is being taken, a spectator throws any object onto the ice or, in the judgment of the Referee, interferes with the player taking the shot or the goalkeeper defending the shot, he shall permit the shot be taken again.</par>
                <par>If, after a player's stick has been ruled illegal, he attempts to take a penalty shot with a second stick that is also ruled illegal prior to taking the penalty shot, the opportunity to take the penalty shot shall be disallowed. The player shall be assessed one minor penalty for the first illegal stick.</par>

            <rule ruleid="24.5" rulename="Face-Off Location">
                <par>If a goal is scored from a penalty shot, the puck shall be faced-off at center ice. If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off at either of the end face-off spots in the zone in which the penalty shot was tried, except when another rule dictates the face-off location should be in an alternate location, such as when the point men enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle or when the attacking team has been penalized on the same play (see Rule [link=76.2]76.2[/link]).</par>
            </rule>
            <rule ruleid="24.6" rulename="Results">
                <par>Should a goal be scored from a penalty shot, a further penalty to the offending player or goalkeeper shall not be applied unless the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was such as to incur a major, match or misconduct penalty, in which case the penalty prescribed for the particular offense shall be imposed.</par>
                <par>If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was such as to normally incur a minor penalty, then regardless of whether the penalty shot results in a goal or not, no further minor penalty shall be served.</par>
                <par>If the offense for which the penalty shot was awarded was such as to incur a double-minor penalty, or where the offending team is assessed an additional minor penalty on the same play in which a penalty shot was awarded, the first minor penalty is not assessed since the penalty shot was awarded to restore the lost scoring opportunity. The second minor penalty would be assessed and served regardless of whether the penalty shot results in a goal. This will be announced as a double-minor penalty for the appropriate foul and the player will serve two (2) minutes only.</par>
                <par>No penalty shall expire when a goal is scored against a team on a penalty shot.</par>
                <par>Should two penalty shots be awarded to the same team at the same stoppage of play (two separate fouls), only one goal can be scored or awarded at a single stoppage of play. Should the first penalty shot result in a goal, the second shot would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served for the infraction committed.</par>

            <rule ruleid="24.7" rulename="Timing">
                <par>If the foul upon which the penalty shot is based occurs during actual playing time, the penalty shot shall be awarded and taken immediately in the usual manner notwithstanding any delay occasioned by a slow whistle by the Referee to allow play to continue until the attacking side has lost possession of the puck to the defending side, which delay results in the expiry of the regular playing time in any period.</par>

                <par>There are four (4) specific conditions that must be met in order for the Referee to award a penalty shot for a player being fouled from behind. They are:</par>
                <par>(i) The infraction must have taken place in the neutral zone or attacking zone, (i.e. over the puck carrier's own blue line);</par>
                <par>(ii) The infraction must have been committed from behind;</par>
                <par>(iii) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score (the fact that he got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the penalty shot consideration criteria. If the foul was from behind and he was denied a "more" reasonable scoring opportunity due to the foul, then the penalty shot should be awarded);</par>
                <par>(iv) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have had no opposing player between himself and the goalkeeper.</par>

                <par>(v) Any potential goal requiring video review must be reviewed prior to or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of video review once the puck has been dropped and play has resumed.</par>

            <rule ruleid="38.2" rulename="Goals">
                <par>Every goal is to be reviewed by the Video Goal Judge.</par>
                <par>Upon making contact with the off-ice official at ice level, the Video Goal Judge should say initially that he is "looking at the play". If there is a need to delay the resumption of the play, the off-ice official at ice level should signal one of the Referees to delay the center ice face-off for a moment. Once the Video Goal Judge has reviewed the video and confirmed that the goal is valid, he should say that "it is a good goal". The off-ice official will then signal to the Referee to resume play.</par>
                <par>If there is a need to expand the review, the Video Goal Judge will advise the off-ice official at ice level and the Public Address Announcer that the "play is under review". Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner. If the review reveals that the goal must be disallowed, the Public Address Announcer shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal as reported by the Referee.</par>
                <par>When the Video Goal Judge observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the on-ice officials he will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform him that a review of the play is in progress.</par>
                <par>When a review is requested by either the Referee or Video Goal Judge, the Public Address Announcer shall make the following announcement: "The play is under review".</par>
                <par>The Video Goal Judge will use all the facilities at his disposal to review the incident and reach a conclusion as to the accurate time of the goal. It is the responsibility of the Video Goal Judge to record the time of the disputed goal and the clock is to be reset accordingly.</par>
                <par>He will report his findings to the Referee as quickly as possible ensuring all available video feeds and angles have been reviewed.</par>
                <par>When the Referee indicates there is to be a video review, all players (with the exception of the goalkeepers) will go to their respective players' bench immediately and failure to do so would result in a game misconduct penalty with a fine to the Coach.</par>

            <rule ruleid="38.4" rulename="Situations Subject to Video Review">
                <par>The following situations are subject to review by the Video Goal Judge:</par>
                <par>(i) Puck crossing the goal line.</par>
                <par>(ii) Puck in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged.</par>
                <par>(iii) Puck in the net prior to, or after expiration of time at the end of the period.</par>
                <par>(iv) Puck directed or batted into the net by a hand or foot or deliberately batted with any part of the attacking player's body. With the use of a foot/skate, was a distinct kicking motion evident? If so, the apparent goal must be disallowed. A DISTINCT KICKING MOTION is one which the player propels the puck with his skate into the net. If the Video Goal Judge / League Office Video Room determines that it was put into the net by an attacking player using a distinct kicking motion, it must be ruled NO GOAL. This would also be true even if the puck, after being kicked, deflects off any other player of either team and then into the net. This is still NO GOAL. However, a puck that enters the goal after deflecting off an attacking player's skate or that deflects off his skate while he is in the process of stopping, shall be ruled a good goal. See also [link=49.2]49.2[/link].</par>
                <par>(v) Puck deflected directly into the net off an Official.</par>
                <par>(vi) Puck struck with a high-stick, above the height of the crossbar, by an attacking player prior to entering the goal. The determining factor is where the puck makes contact with the stick in relation to the crossbar. If the puck makes contact with the portion of the stick that is at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed.</par>
                <par>(vii) To establish the correct time on the official game clock, provided the game time is visible on the Video Goal Judge's monitors.</par>
                <par>(viii) The video review process shall be permitted to assist the Referees in determining the legitimacy of all potential goals (e.g. to ensure they are "good hockey goals"). For example (but not limited to), pucks that enter the net by going through the net meshing, pucks that enter the net from underneath the net frame, pucks that hit the spectator netting prior to being directed into the goal, pucks that enter the net undetected by the Referee, etc. This would also include situations whereby the Referee stops play or is in the process of stopping the play because he has lost sight of the puck and it is subsequently determined by video review that the puck crosses (or has crossed) the goal line and enters the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the result was unaffected by the whistle (i.e., the timing of the whistle was irrelevant to the puck entering the net at the end of a continuous play).</par>

The severity of the penalty, based upon the impact with the boards, shall be at the discretion of the Referee.</par>
                <par>There is an enormous amount of judgment involved in the application of this rule by the Referees. The onus is on the player applying the check to ensure his opponent is not in a defenseless position and if so, he must avoid or minimize contact. However, in determining whether such contact could have been avoided, the circumstances of the check, including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the check or whether the check was unavoidable can be considered. This balance must be considered by the Referees when applying this rule.</par>
                <par>Any unnecessary contact with a player playing the puck on an obvious "icing" or "off-side" play which results in that player hitting or impacting the boards is "boarding" and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the boards, it should be treated as "charging."</par>

            <rule ruleid="56.1" rulename="Interference">
                <par>A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the rink.</par>
                <par>Body Position: Body position shall be determined as the player skating in front of or beside his opponent, traveling in the same direction. A player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use his stick, body or free hand in order to restrain his opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish his proper position in order to make a check.</par>
                <par>A player is allowed the ice he is standing on (body position) and is not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A player may "block" the path of an opponent provided he is in front of his opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without establishing body position, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as interference. A player is always entitled to use his body position to lengthen an opponent's path to the puck, provided his stick is not utilized (to make himself "bigger" and therefore considerably lengthening the distance his opponent must travel to get where he is going); his free hand is not used and he does not take advantage of his body position to deliver an otherwise illegal check.</par>
                <par>Possession of the Puck:</par>
                <par>The last player to touch the puck, other than the goalkeeper, shall be considered the player in possession. The player deemed in possession of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following his loss of possession.</par>
                <par>Restrain: The actions of a player who does not have body position, but instead uses illegal means (e.g. hook with stick; hold with hands, trip with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in possession of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a player or goalkeeper to establish, maintain or restore body position other than by skating.</par>
                <par>Pick: A "pick" is the action of a player who checks an opponent who is not in possession of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit. A player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal "battle for the puck," may not be interfered with by a player or goalkeeper delivering a "pick." A player delivering a "pick" is one who moves into an opponent's path without initially having body position, thereby taking him out of the play. When this is done, an interference penalty shall be assessed.</par>
                <par>Free Hand: When a free hand is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving freely, this must be penalized as holding. The free hand may be used by a player to "fend off" an opponent or his stick, but may not be used to hold an opponent's stick or body.</par>
                <par>Stick: A player who does not have body position on his opponent, who uses his stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent his opponent from moving freely on the ice shall be assessed a hooking penalty.</par>

                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on an attacking player who deliberately checks a defensive player, including the goalkeeper, who is not in possession of the puck.</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on a player who shall cause an opponent who is not in possession of the puck to be forced off-side, causing a stoppage in play. If this action causes a delayed off-side (and not necessarily a stoppage in play), then the application of a penalty for interference is subject to the judgment of the Referee.</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on a player who deliberately knocks a stick out of an opponent's hand, or who prevents a player who has dropped his stick or any other piece of equipment from regaining possession of it.</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on a player who knocks or shoots any abandoned or broken stick or illegal puck or other debris towards an opposing puck carrier in a manner that could cause him to be distracted. (See also Rule [link=53]53[/link] - Throwing Equipment.)</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on any identifiable player on the players' bench or penalty bench who, by means of his stick or his body, interferes with the movements of the puck or any opponent on the ice during the progress of the play. In addition, should a player about to come onto the ice, play the puck while one or both skates are still on the players' or penalty bench, a minor penalty for interference shall be assessed.</par>
                <par>The appropriate penalty according to the playing rules shall be assessed when a player on the players' or penalty bench gets involved with an opponent on the ice during a stoppage in play. The player(s) involved may be subject to additional sanctions as appropriate pursuant to Rule [link=28]28[/link] - Supplementary Discipline.</par>

            <rule ruleid="57.3" rulename="Penalty Shot">
                <par>When a player, in the neutral or attacking zone, in control of the puck (or who could have obtained possession and control of the puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the goalkeeper, is tripped or otherwise fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring opportunity, a penalty shot shall be awarded to the non-offending team. Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking team has lost possession of the puck to the defending team.</par>
                <par>The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable scoring opportunity which has been lost. If, however, the player fouled is able to recover and obtain a reasonable scoring opportunity (or a teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no penalty shot should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play.</par>
                <par>"Control of the puck" means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand or feet. If while it is being propelled, the puck is touched by another player or his equipment, or hits the goal or goes free, the player shall no longer be considered to be "in control of the puck".</par>
                <par>In order for a penalty shot to be awarded for a player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met:</par>
                <par>(i) The infraction must have taken place in the neutral or attacking zone (i.e. over the puck carrier's own blue line).</par>
                <par>(ii) The infraction must have been committed from behind.</par>
                <par>(iii) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the player clearly would have obtained possession and control of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the player got a shot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the penalty shot consideration criteria. If the foul was from behind and the player was denied a "more" reasonable scoring opportunity due to the foul, then the penalty shot should still be awarded.</par>
                <par>(iv) The player in possession and control (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the player clearly would have obtained possession and control) must have had no opposing player between himself and the goalkeeper.</par>
                <par>If, in the opinion of the Referee, a player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no penalty shot will be awarded, but a minor penalty for tripping shall be assessed.</par>
                <par>It should be noted that if the attacking player manages to get around the goalkeeper and has no defending player between him and the open goal, and he is fouled from behind by the goalkeeper or another defending player, no goal can be awarded since the goalkeeper is still on the ice. A penalty shot would be awarded.</par>

                <par>A minor penalty for delay of game shall be imposed on any player who deliberately shoots or bats (using his hand or his stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play.</par>
                <par>When any player, with both of his skates inside his defending zone, shoots or bats (using his hand or his stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface, except where there is no glass, a penalty shall be assessed for delaying the game. When the puck is shot into the players' bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck is shot over the glass behind' the players' bench, the penalty will be assessed. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a face-off, no penalty shall be assessed.</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on any player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a goal post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending team gains control of the puck.</par>
                <par>In the event that a goalpost is deliberately displaced by a defending player, prior to the puck crossing the goal line between the normal position of the goalposts, the Referee shall assess a minor penalty for delaying the game if the attacking player has not yet taken the shot or in the act of taking the shot at the open net (see [link=63.6]63.6[/link]).</par>
                <par>When the net is accidentally displaced by an attacking player, and the defending side is in control of the puck and moving out of their zone, play shall be permitted to continue until such time as the non-offending team loses control of the puck. The resulting face-off will take place at a face-off spot in the zone nearest the location where the play was stopped, unless it is in the non-offending team's defending zone, and as such the ensuing face-off would be outside the blue line at one of the face-off spots in the neutral zone. It is possible for a goal to be scored at one end of the rink while the net at the other end has been dislodged, provided that the team being scored upon is the team responsible for dislodging the net at the other end of the rink.</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on a player other than the goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into his body. Any player who drops to his knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under him or becomes lodged in his clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly.</par>
                <par>If a goalkeeper comes out of his crease to "cut down the angle" on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal. If the goalkeeper races out of his crease in an attempt to beat the attacking player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play, this shall be a minor penalty for delay of game.</par>
                <par>A minor penalty shall be imposed on a goalkeeper who, when he is in his own goal crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into his body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless he is actually being checked by an opponent.</par>
                <par>A goalkeeper shall not play the puck outside of the designated area behind the net. Should the goalkeeper play the puck outside of the designated area behind the goal line, a minor penalty for delay of game shall be imposed. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. The minor penalty will not be assessed when a goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with his goal crease.</par>
                <par>Play shall not be stopped nor the game delayed by reasons of adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates or sticks. For an infringement of this rule, a minor penalty shall be given. No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a minor penalty may be assessed.</par>
                <par>No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of goalkeeper's equipment. If adjustments are required, the goalkeeper shall leave the ice and his place shall be taken by the substitute goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a goalkeeper, a minor penalty shall be imposed.</par>

                <par>In the event that objects are thrown on the ice that interfere with the progress of the game, the Referee shall blow the whistle and stop the play and the puck shall be faced-off at a face-off spot in the zone nearest to the spot where play is stopped. When objects are thrown on the ice during a stoppage in play, including after the scoring of a goal, the Referee shall have announced over the public address system that any further occurrences will result in a bench minor penalty being assessed to the home Team. Articles thrown onto the ice following a special occasion (i.e. hat trick) will not result in a bench minor penalty being assessed.

            <rule ruleid="63.5" rulename="Penalty Shot">
                <par>If the goal post is deliberately displaced by a goalkeeper or player during the course of a "breakaway," a penalty shot will be awarded to the non-offending team, which shot shall be taken by the player last in possession of the puck.</par>
                <par>If by reason of insufficient time in the regular playing time or by reason of penalties already imposed, the minor penalty assessed to a player for deliberately displacing his own goal post cannot be served in its entirety within the regular playing time of the game or at any time in overtime, a penalty shot shall be awarded against the offending team.</par>
                <par>No defending player, except the goalkeeper, will be permitted to fall on the puck, hold the puck, pick up the puck, or gather the puck into the body or hands when the puck is within the goal crease. For infringement of this rule, play shall immediately be stopped and a penalty shot shall be ordered against the offending team, but no other penalty shall be given. The rule shall be interpreted so that a penalty shot will be awarded only when the puck is in the crease at the instant the offense occurs. However, in cases where the puck is outside the crease, Rule [link=63]63[/link] may still apply and a minor penalty may be imposed, even though no penalty shot is awarded. The significant factor when determining whether or not a penalty shot is warranted is the location of the puck at the time it was held, grabbed or gathered into the body. If the puck is in the crease, penalty shot. If the puck is outside the crease and gathered into the body of a player (other than the goalkeeper) who is inside the crease, minor penalty).

                <par>In order to award a goal in this situation, the goal post must have been displaced by the actions of a defending player, the puck must have been shot (or the player must be in the act of shooting) at the goal prior to the goal post being displaced, and it must be determined that the puck would have entered the net between the normal position of the goal posts.</par>
                <par>When the goal post has been displaced deliberately by the defending team when their goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker thereby preventing an impending goal by the attacking team, the Referee shall award a goal to the attacking team.</par>
                <par>The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.</par>

            <rule ruleid="69.1" rulename="Interference on the Goalkeeper">
                <par>This rule is based on the premise that an attacking player's position, whether inside or outside the crease, should not, by itself, determine whether a goal should be allowed or disallowed. In other words, goals scored while attacking players are standing in the crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. Goals should be disallowed only if: (1) an attacking player, either by his positioning or by contact, impairs the goalkeeper's ability to move freely within his crease or defend his goal; or (2) an attacking player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, inside or outside of his goal crease. Incidental contact with a goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the goal crease, provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact. The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), and not by means of video replay or review.</par>
                <par>For purposes of this rule, "contact," whether incidental or otherwise, shall mean any contact that is made between or among a goalkeeper and attacking player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body.</par>
                <par>The overriding rationale of this rule is that a goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within his goal crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking player. If an attacking player enters the goal crease and, by his actions, impairs the goalkeeper's ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.</par>
                <par>If an attacking player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending player so as to cause him to come into contact with the goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.</par>
                <par>If a defending player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking player so as to cause the defending player to come into contact with his own goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary a penalty assessed to the attacking player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.</par>

            <rule ruleid="69.2" rulename="Penalty">
                <par>In all cases in which an attacking player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, whether or not the goalkeeper is inside or outside the goal crease, and whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking player will receive a penalty (minor or major, as the Referee deems appropriate). In all cases where the infraction being imposed is to the attacking player for hindering the goalkeeper's ability to move freely in his goal crease, the penalty to be assessed is for goalkeeper interference.</par>
                <par>In exercising his judgment, the Referee should give more significant consideration to the degree and nature of the contact with the goalkeeper than to the exact location of the goalkeeper at the time of the contact.</par>

                <par>If a goalkeeper, in the act of establishing his position within his goal crease, initiates contact with an attacking player who is in the goal crease, and this results in an impairment of the goalkeeper's ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.</par>
                <par>If, after any contact by a goalkeeper who is attempting to establish position in his goal crease, the attacking player does not immediately vacate his current position in the goal crease (i.e. give ground to the goalkeeper), and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. In all such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking player will receive a minor penalty for goalkeeper interference.</par>
                <par>If an attacking player establishes a significant position within the goal crease, so as to obstruct the goalkeeper's vision and impair his ability to defend his goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.</par>
                <par>For this purpose, a player "establishes a significant position within the crease" when, in the Referee's judgment, his body, or a substantial portion thereof, is within the goal crease for more than an instantaneous period of time.</par>

                <par>A goalkeeper is not "fair game" just because he is outside the goal crease. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an attacking player makes unnecessary contact with the goalkeeper. However, incidental contact will be permitted when the goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside his goal crease provided the attacking player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such unnecessary contact.</par>
                <par>When a goalkeeper has played the puck outside of his crease and is then prevented from returning to his crease area due to the deliberate actions of an attacking player, such player may be penalized for goalkeeper interference. Similarly, the goalkeeper may be penalized, if by his actions outside of his crease he deliberately interferes with an attacking player who is attempting to play the puck or an opponent.</par>

                <par>The action of the Referee or Linesman in dropping the puck between the sticks of two opposing players to start or resume play. A face-off begins when the official indicates the location of the face-off and the officials and players take their appropriate positions. The face-off ends when the puck has been legally dropped.</par>
                <par>A goalkeeper may not participate in a face-off.</par>

                <par>All face-offs must be conducted on one of the nine (9) face-off spots located on the rink.</par>
                <par>When a stoppage of play has been caused by any player of the attacking side in the attacking zone, the ensuing face-off shall be made in the neutral zone on the nearest face-off spot. If two rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (ie. high-sticking the puck and intentional off-side), the ensuing face-off location shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of territorial advantage to the offending team.</par>
                <par>When the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either team while the puck is in the neutral zone, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot outside the blue line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of the four face-off spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the home team the greatest territorial advantage in the neutral zone will be selected for the ensuing face-off.</par>
                <par>When players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one team, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at one of the two face-off spots in the offending team's end zone. There are only four exceptions to this application:</par>
                <par>(i) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal - face-off at center ice;</par>
                <par>(ii) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period - face-off at center ice;</par>
                <par>(iii) when the defending team is penalized and the attacking players enter the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle - face-off in the neutral zone (see paragraph 11 of this section);</par>
                <par>(iv) when the team not being penalized ices the puck - face-off in the neutral zone outside the blue line of the team icing the puck.</par>
                <par>When an infringement of a rule has been committed by players of both sides in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing face-off will be made at the nearest face-off spot in that zone.</par>
                <par>When stoppage occurs between the end face-off spots and near end of the rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end face-off spot on the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules.</par>
                <par>No face-off shall be made within fifteen feet (15') of the goal or side boards nor anywhere other than at a face-off spot.</par>
                <par>When a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an official, the resulting face-off shall be made at the nearest face-off spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the official.</par>
                <par>When a goal is illegally scored by the attacking team by directing, batting, kicking or high-sticking the puck into the goal, the resulting face-off shall take place in the neutral zone at the nearest face-off spot.</par>
                <par>When the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be faced-off at a face-off spot in the zone nearest to where it was last played.</par>
                <par>Following a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the point players or any player coming from the bench of the attacking team, enter into the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle during an altercation, gathering or "scrum," the ensuing face-off shall take place in the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team. This rule also applies when an icing, an intentional off-side, or a high-sticking the puck violation (by the team of greater numerical strength of its opponent) has occurred, and the ensuing face-off is to be in the offending team's defending zone. Should any of the non-offending players enter into the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle during an altercation, gathering or "scrum," the ensuing face-off shall take place in the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team.</par>
                <par>For a violation of Rule [link=71]71[/link] - Premature Substitution, the resulting face-off will take place at the center ice face-off spot when play is stopped beyond the center red line. When play is stopped prior to the center red line, the resulting face-off shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot in the zone where the play was stopped.</par>
                <par>When play is stopped for an injured player, the ensuing face-off shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the location of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured player's team has control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at one of the face-off spots outside the blue line in the neutral zone. When the injured player is in his defending zone and the attacking team is in control of the puck in the attacking zone, the face-off shall be conducted at one of the defending team's end-zone face-off spots.</par>

                <par>As soon as the line change procedure has been completed by the Referee and he lowers his hand to indicate no further changes, the Linesman conducting the face-off shall blow his whistle. This will signal to both teams that they have no more than five (5) seconds to line up for the ensuing face-off. At the end of the five (5) seconds (or sooner if both centers are ready), the Linesman will conduct a proper face-off. If, however:</par>

                <par>In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time or any time in overtime, the Linesman will still blow his whistle to initiate the face-off, but the five (5) second time limit will not be enforced. However, players must abide by the verbal directions given by the Linesman in his attempt to conduct a fast and fair face-off.</par>
            </rule>
            <rule ruleid="76.4" rulename="Procedure - Centers">
                <par>The puck shall be faced-off by the Referee or the Linesman dropping the puck on the ice between the sticks of the players facing-off. Players facing-off will stand squarely facing their opponent's end of the rink approximately one stick length apart with the blade of their sticks on the ice.</par>
                <par>When the face-off takes place in any of the end face-off circles, the players taking part shall take their position so that they will stand squarely facing their opponent's end of the rink, and clear of the ice markings. The sticks of both players facing-off shall have the blade on the ice, within the designated white area. The visiting player shall place his stick within the designated white area first followed immediately by the home player.</par>
                <par>If a player facing-off fails to take his proper position immediately when directed by the official, the official may order him replaced for that face-off by any teammate then on the ice.</par>
                <par>If a center is not at the designated face-off area once the five (5) second time limit has elapsed, the Linesman will drop the puck immediately. If the center is back from the face-off spot, is "quarterbacking" or refuses to come into the face-off area when instructed to do so by the Linesman, or the center is simply slow getting to the face-off spot when the five (5) seconds has elapsed, the puck shall be dropped. If the center attempts to arrive at the face-off spot just as the five seconds elapses in an attempt to gain an advantage to win the face-off, he is to be removed from the face-off and replaced, resulting in a face-off violation. If the face-off is a result of an icing infraction and the center attempts to arrive at the face-off spot just as the five seconds elapse to gain an advantage to win the face-off, he shall not be removed from the face-off. The center will be warned by the Linesman that he has committed a face-off violation. In the event the center then commits a second face-off violation or the action actually is the second face-off violation, a bench minor penalty shall be assessed.</par>
                <par>If a player is ejected from the face-off, his replacement must come into position quickly or risk having the puck dropped by the Linesman without the player being set, or ejected from the face-off by the Linesman resulting in a bench minor penalty for delay of game for a second face-off violation during the same face-off.</par>
                <par>When a team commits an icing infraction, any face-off violation will not result in the center being removed. The center will be warned by the Linesman that the team has committed their first face-off violation and any subsequent violation will result in a bench minor penalty for delay of game - face-off violation being assessed.</par>
                <par>Both players facing-off are prohibited from batting the puck with their hand in an attempt to win the face-off. Any attempt by either center to win the face-off by batting the puck with their hand shall result in a minor penalty. This penalty shall be announced as "Minor Penalty for Delay of Game - Face-off Violation". The two players involved in the actual face-off (the centers) are not permitted to play the puck with their hand without incurring a penalty under this rule until such time as a third player (from either team) has at least touched the puck. Once the face-off is deemed complete (and a winner of the face-off is clear) hand passes shall be enforced as per Rule [link=79]79[/link].</par>

                <par>No other player shall be allowed to enter the face-off circle or come within fifteen feet (15') of the players facing-off. All players must stand on-side on all face-offs.</par>
                <par>During end-zone face-offs, all other players on the ice must position their bodies on their own side of the restraining lines marked on the outer edge of the face-off circles.</par>
                <par>If a player other than the player taking the face-off moves into the face-off circle prior to the dropping of the puck, then the offending team's player taking the face-off shall be ejected from the face-off circle. This shall be considered a face-off violation.</par>
                <par>Players on the attacking team (exclusive of the center) must establish their position first and then the defending team may counter and hold its position until the puck is dropped. A violation of this procedure shall be treated as face-off encroachment and the Linesman shall order the center of the offending team replaced. Should an attacking player attempt to establish a new position prior to the face-off, and the defending center steps back from the face-off spot in order to reposition his teammates, the face-off violation shall be charged to the attacking team as they must establish their position first.</par>

                <par>When a least two face-off violations have been committed by the same team during the same face-off, this team shall be penalized with a bench minor penalty to the offending team. This penalty shall be announced as a "Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game - Face-off Violation."</par>
                <par>Face-off violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four on-ice officials may identify a face-off violation):</par>
                <par>(i) Encroachment by any player other than the center into the face-off area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on the perimeter of the face-off circle must keep both skates outside the face-off circle (skate contact with the line is permitted). If a player's skate crosses the line into the face-off circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a face-off violation. A player's stick may be inside the face-off circle provided there is no physical contact with his opponent or his opponent's stick.</par>
                <par>(ii) Encroachment by any player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the face-off circle prior to the puck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact with the line with their skate is permitted. If a player's skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a face-off violation. A player's stick may be inside the area between the hash marks provided there is no physical contact with his opponent or his opponent's stick.</par>
                <par>(iii) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped.</par>
                <par>(iv) Failure by either center taking the face-off to properly position himself behind the restraining lines or place his stick on the ice (as outlined in Rule [link=76.4]76.4[/link]). "Properly position himself behind the restraining lines" shall mean that the center must place his feet on either side of the restraining lines that are parallel to the side boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of his skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side boards as he approaches the face-off spot.</par>
                <par>The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice (at least the toe of the blade of the stick) in the designated white area of the face- off spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped.</par>
                <par>Failure to comply with this positioning and face-off procedure will result in a face-off violation.</par>
                <par>Whenever a team has committed two face-off violations during the same face-off, the Referee shall immediately assess the offending team a bench minor penalty for delay of game. This penalty shall be announced as a "Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game - Face-off Violation."</par>
                <par>Players who are late to the face-off location and therefore in an off- side position for the ensuing face-off will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending team's Coach. In this situation, the offending team's center is not ejected from the face-off. Any subsequent violation shall result in a bench minor penalty for delay of game being assessed to the offending team. This penalty shall be announced as a "Bench Minor Penalty for Delay of Game - Slow Proceeding to Face-off Location."</par>
                <par>In the conduct of any face-off at any of the nine (9) face-off spots on the playing surface, no player facing-off shall make any physical contact with his opponent's body by means of his own body or by his stick except in the course of playing the puck after the face-off has been completed.</par>
                <par>For violation of this rule, the Referee may, at his discretion impose a minor penalty or penalties on the player(s) whose action(s) caused the physical contact. Nonetheless, this physical contact prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a face-off violation and the Linesman shall order the center of the offending team replaced.</par>
                <par>Face-off encroachment may be applied during face-offs at any of the nine (9) face-off spots on the playing surface. However, since no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) face-off spots adjacent to the blue lines, Linesmen shall use their judgment as to whether or not a violation has occurred. All players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the face-off location similar to being outside the face-off circle for face-offs in the end zones.</par>
            </rule>
            <rule ruleid="76.7" rulename="Line Changes">
                <par>No substitution of players shall be permitted until the face-off has been completed and play has resumed except when a penalty is imposed which affects the on-ice strength of either team.</par>
                <par>Should an on-ice official notice that the defending team has not placed enough players on the ice for the ensuing face-off, the Referee in the neutral zone shall be notified and he will instruct the offending team to place another player(s) on the ice. If, in the opinion of the Referee that this is being done as a stalling tactic, he will issue a warning to the offending team's Coach and any subsequent violations shall result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for delay of game.</par>
                <par>Should an on-ice official notice that the attacking team has not placed enough players on the ice for the ensuing face-off, the Linesman will proceed with conducting the face-off in the normal manner.

                <par>It is the responsibility of the Official Scorer to award goals and assists, and his decision in this respect is final, notwithstanding the report of the Referee or any other game official. The use of video replay to verify the proper awarding of a goal or an assist is essential. Such awards shall be made or withheld strictly in accordance with the provisions of this rule. Therefore, it is essential that the Official Scorer be thoroughly familiar with every aspect of this rule; be alert to observe all actions which could affect the awarding of a goal or assist; and, above all, give or withhold awards with absolute impartiality.</par>
                <par>In case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes should not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has signed the game report (except by the League's Chief Statistician).</par>
                <par>The team scoring the greatest number of goals during the three (3) twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with two points in the League standings. In the event a winner during the regular season is determined in the overtime period or the shootout, the winning team shall be credited with two points in the League standings and the losing team will be credited with one point in the League standings.</par>

The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but as long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in the ice and the goal post, the goal frame shall be deemed to be in its proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in contact with the holes in the ice and the goal posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced.</par>
                <par>A goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any way by a player of the defending side. The player of the attacking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal but no assist shall be awarded.</par>
                <par>If an attacking player has the puck deflect into the net, off his skate or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The player who deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal.</par>

                <par>(i) When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an attacking player other than with a stick.</par>
                <par>(ii) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion.</par>
                <par>(iii) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official.</par>
                <par>(iv) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible player is on the ice.</par>
                <par>(v) When an attacking player has interfered with a goalkeeper in his goal crease.</par>
                <par>(vi) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking player's stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor. See [link=38.4]38.4[/link](vi).</par>
                <par>(vii) When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed.</par>
                <par>(viii) When a Linesman reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking, a major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the appropriate penalty assessed.</par>
                <par>(ix) When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save. See also [link=69.6]69.6[/link].</par>
                <par>(x) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.</par>
                <par>(xi) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot score unless the non-offending team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending player or any physical action by an offending player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending team's goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team.</par>
                <par>(xii) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.</par>

                <par>Any potential goal requiring video review must be reviewed prior to or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of video review once the puck has been dropped and play has resumed. See Rule [link=38]38[/link].</par>
                <par>When a team scores an apparent goal that is not seen by the on-ice officials and play continues, the play shall be reviewed by the Video Goal Judge at the next stoppage of play. If the goal is confirmed by video review, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) is re-set to the time the goal was scored. If the goal is not confirmed by video review, no adjustment is required to the clock time.</par>
                <par>Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play. If the apparent goal was scored by Team A, and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by the Video Goal Judge, any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal By Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B's goal), the Team B goal would not be awarded. However, if the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal, albeit illegally (i.e. distinct kicking motion), the goal shall be disallowed by the Video Goal Judge and since the play should have stopped for this disallowed goal, no goal can be awarded to Team B on the same play. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) must be re-set to the time of the disallowed Team A goal and play resumed.</par>
                <par>Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a minor penalty is to be assessed to the team scored upon, and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal. Refer to Rules [link=16.2]16.2[/link] and [link=18.2]18.2[/link]. If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by the Video Goal Judge.</par>

                <par>A player shall be permitted to catch the puck out of the air but must immediately place it or knock it down to the ice.

                <par>For the purpose of this rule, the center red line will divide the ice into halves. Should any player of a team, equal or superior in numerical strength (power-play) to the opposing team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from his own half of the ice beyond the goal line of the opposing team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally propelled down the ice by the offending team.</par>
                <par>For the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the team in possession shall be used to determine whether icing has occurred or not. As such, the team in possession must "gain the line" in order for the icing to be nullified. "Gaining the line" shall mean that the puck, while on the player's stick (not the player's skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to nullify a potential icing.</par>
                <par>For the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for "icing the puck". The Linesman must first determine that the puck will cross the goal line. Once the Linesman determines that the puck will cross the goal line, icing is completed upon the determination as to which player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck. This decision by the Linesman will be made by no later than the instant the first player reaches the end zone face- off dots with the player's skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the boards and/or back towards the end zone face-off dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesman shall determine within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first.</par>
                <par>For clarification, the determining factor is which player would first touch the puck, not which player would first reach the end zone face- off dots.</par>
                <par>If the race for the puck is too close to determine by the time the first player reaches the end zone face-off dots, icing shall be called.</par>
                <par>The puck striking or deflecting off an official does not automatically nullify a potential icing.</par>

                <par>If during the period of a delayed whistle due to a foul by a player of the side not in possession, the side in possession "ices" the puck, then the face-off following the stoppage of play shall take place in the neutral zone near the defending blue line of the team icing the puck.</par>
                <par>If, in the opinion of the Referee, the defending side intentionally abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position to do so, he shall stop the play and order the resulting face-off on the adjacent corner face-off spot nearest the goal of the team at fault.</par>

                <par>If, however, a goalkeeper is legitimately out of the crease in an attempt to go to the players' bench to be substituted for an extra attacker and in no way makes an attempt to play the puck, the icing should not be nullified under this section.</par>

This includes the situation whereby the opposing team, while in the process of making player substitutions during the play, are able to play the puck, but choose not to do so to avoid being called for too many men on the ice.

                <par>It should be noted that while the position of the player's skates is what determines whether a player is "off-side," nevertheless the question of an "off-side" never arises until the puck has completely crossed the leading edge of the blue line at which time the decision is to be made.</par>

                <par>If, during a delayed off-side, an attacking player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to his players' bench (which extends into the attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, he shall be considered to have cleared the zone provided he is completely off the ice and his replacement comes onto the ice in the neutral zone. If his replacement comes onto the ice in the attacking zone, if the delayed off-side is still in effect, he too must clear the attacking zone.

Should the puck, as a result of this shot, enter the defending team's goal, either directly or off the goalkeeper, a player, the boards, the glass, a piece of equipment or an official on the ice, the goal shall be disallowed as the original shot was off-side. The fact that the attacking team may have cleared the zone prior to the puck entering the goal has no bearing on this ruling.
